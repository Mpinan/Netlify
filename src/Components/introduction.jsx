                In early 2019 I made the decision to hang up my apron and change my life by learning how to code.
                At the time, I did not even know about the existence of ‘GitHub’ and five months later, here I am, a full stack
                junior developer.
            <br/>
                For years I have had a strong interest in technology, its components and the way in which different parts work
                together.
                This has spurred an interest in coding, as I sought to understand the work behind the scenes, how to find the
                source of a problem and fix it in a methodical way.
                As a Makers graduate, I am seeking an opportunity to begin an exciting career while furthering my knowledge of
                computer programming.
